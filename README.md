# IdentifyFakeJobPostings
My Second AI based Project
Fake job postings have become an increasing threat to job seekers, leading to wasted time, financial scams, and privacy breaches. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can automatically classify job listings as real or fake based on their content and metadata.
Leveraging techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, this project demonstrates a complete pipeline â€” from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and analysis.
Result: The best performing model achieved high accuracy and strong recall for identifying fake job postings, significantly reducing the chances of false positives and negatives.
Future Work: 
Deploy the model as an API for real-time fake job posting detection
Explore deep learning models for improved text understanding
Enhance feature extraction using advanced NLP techniques (e.g., BERT embeddings)
